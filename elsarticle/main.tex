\begin{abstract}
We assess the environmental impact of dynamic, adaptive, building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems. Such systems combine the benefits of adaptive shading with facade integrated solar tracking, thus reducing the building energy demand and generating electricity on-site. The inventory for the life cycle assessment (LCA) was acquired using production data, and Energy Plus simulations to calculate the building energy demand. The impact assessment was conducted according to ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 standards using the Eco-invent database and openLCA as an analysis tool. The embodied environmental impact of a dynamic BIPV solution is higher than a static solution due to the added control system, electronics, actuators, and additional supporting structure. However the added savings through adaptive shading to the building's heating, cooling and lighting loads offsets the entire embodied environmental impact three-fold. This demonstrates the advantage of using the PV material, not only as an electricity generation unit, but also as a building element for adaptive shading systems. We also conduct a sensitivity analysis to investigate modifications to the actuator type, and the control system. The analysis ultimately enables us to provide design recommendations for future dynamic BIPV installations.
