- In the last decades, building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) have been adopted as part of the energy strategy towards 2050... (advantages of BIPV, potential of BIPV)\\
% Do we have a source for "have been adopted as part of the energy strategy towards 2050"?
%Yes - PJ

- The current developments of light-weight efficient thin film technologies have brought new design possibilities for architects in BIPV design... (Adaptive Building Envelopes, examples, Envelope is the barrier between the internal and external environment, Advantages, seamless coupling with solar tracking mechanics) \\

- The aim of this paper is to analyse the life cycle emissions of an adaptive solar facade and provide comparisons with standard shading systems and static BIPV solutions.\\
