We present the results of the LCA analysis in relation to the 1) operational savings through our energy plus simulation, 2) Embodied GWP, 3) a calculation of the emission factor, 4) global distribution of GWP, 5) regional effects of terrestrial acidification, 6) sensitivity of the LCA to design and location, and 7) a comparison to other PV technologies.

\subsection{Operational Savings through Adaptive Shading}
\label{ch:oppResults}

The building energy load in terms of heating, cooling and lighting were simulated in Energy Plus as detailed in Section \ref{ch:method}. We calculated a total energy saving of 25\% compared to louvers at 45$^\circ$ and 56\% compared to a case with no facade shading \cite{jayathissa2015abs}. These results are sumarised in Figure \ref{fig:operational}. 


\textcolor{magenta}{This is entirely(?) due to the reduced cooling load, because the interior receives less solar loads, compared to the other two variants.}\textcolor{blue}{Not really. The ASF compared to static shading performs better in terms of heating and lighting}

\subsection{LCA of the Adaptive Solar Facade Manufacture}

A breakdown of the embodied carbon emissions can be found in Figure  \ref{fig:embodied}. The largest embodied global warming potential (GWP) contribution in the ASF comes from the solar panels, the electronics and the supporting structure.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Calculation of Emission Factor}
The combined GWP of the ASF can be built up using a waterfall chart as shown in  Figure \ref{fig:waterfall}. This gives us a total GWP of -4090kg CO$_{2eq}$. We calculate a total electricity production of 580kWh per year, resulting in an emission factor of \textcolor{red}{-352gCO2/kWh}.

\caption{Waterfall diagram of GWP of the ASF. The far left bar details the embodied carbon emissions. The second bar details the emission reduction of the building through the smart shading algorithms of the ASF. The third, fourth and fifth bar shows the effect of dynamic actuation, maintenance, and disposal respectively. This leaves us with a final emissions value (grey bar). When we apply this value to Equation \ref{eq:EF}, we obtain an emission factor per kWh of -470.1 g CO$_2$-eq./kWh.\textcolor{magenta}{\textit{The figure total has numbers}}}

\subsection{Global Distribution of GWP and Terrestrial Acidification}
\textcolor{magenta}{\textit{I still think this is adding noise rather than useful information for a reader interested in BIPV. Plus I question the correctness of these figures. I would \textbf{only} keep this section if you draw meaningful conclusions from it. If you need references on regionalized LCIA (e.g. for the discussion), let me know... This is the only time you talk about acidification. You would need to justify that too.}}

The global distribution of embodied GWP emissions is focused in Europe, specifically Germany and Switzerland as most of the manufacturing is done in this region. It can be see however that emissions occur globally due the sourcing of primary materials from many locations around the world. Terrestrial acidification however is more interesting as it has a local impact compared to carbon emissions. It is interesting to note that China carries the greatest burden of terrestrial acidification from the ASF production.

\subsection{Sensitivity Analysis}

The results of the sensitivity analysis is shown in Figure \ref{fig:sens}. The operational GWP savings is dependent on the \textcolor{magenta}{substituted \textit{(The substitution / credits also needs to be explained in the methodology!)}} electricity mix as explained in Section \ref{ch:Meth:Opp}. Changing our assumption from the European ENTSO-E mix to a country specific mix brings interesting results. In Switzerland, the mix is dominated by hydro and nuclear power which has a very low GWP potential [citation needed \textcolor{magenta}{ \textit{ecoinvent?}}]. This would then increase the emission factor to (100 g CO2/kWh\textcolor{magenta}{\textit{(give numbers for other mixes as well)}}), which is only \textcolor{red}{6\%} higher than the emission factor in Switzerland. The German mix on the other hand has a higher GWP mix than the ENTSO-E mix due to their high share in coal fire plants. This then reducing our emission factor futher \textcolor{red}{[Double Check this]}.\\

The choice of actuator also has a large impact on the GWP of the embodied carbon. A single Soft Robotic Actuator, including the air compressor and tubing comes to \textcolor{red}{20kgCO2/sqm} per unit whereas a classical servo motor is four times greater at \textcolor{red}{80kgCO2/sqm} \textcolor{magenta}{\textit{(Is this figure cited or was it also calculated? Do we provide the inventory?)}}.\\

The control system design should be carefully through out due to the high GWP of electronic components [REFERENCE REQUIRED]. The control system required for an ASF where each panel can be independently actuated emits \textcolor{red}{35 \%} more CO2 as a control system where only rows are independently actuated.\\

\textcolor{red}{The Monte Carlo Simulation did not yield any significant results / was significant. } \textcolor{blue}{Fill this out once your results come in}


% In Switzerland, we see a 6\% reduction compared to the average electricity mix. This is because the Swiss electricity mix is dominated by hydro and nuclear power which has a very low GWP potential [citation needed\textcolor{magenta}{ \textit{ecoinvent?}}]. In Germany on the other hand, the ASF has a 81\% reduction in carbon emissions as the emission factor of the electricity grid is roughly five times higher compared to Switzerland [citation needed] due to the relatively high share in coal-fired power plants.\\

\subsection{Comparison to existing PV technologies}

Comparison of the ASF to other PV technologies and the ENTSO-E electricity mix is highlighted in Figure \ref{fig:compPV}. Because the GWP savings through adaptive shading offsets the entire embodied GWP three fold, we have a system that has a negative emission factor. \textcolor{magenta}{\textit{I am a bit uncomfortable with the comparison. This is only true if we assume that we substitute today's ENTSOE. I would try to describe that in more detail.}} It is this multifunctional nature that makes it superior to other technological choices. \textcolor{magenta}{\textit{(what a result ;P -- I think this is a strong statement)}} However, if the benefits of adaptive shading are not present, i.e. it is mounted on an opaque building surface, then we see an under performance to other static PV technologies. 

Figure \ref{fig:compPV} also highlights a case in Switzerland where the electricity mix has a low GWP. It is capable of out performing Silicone based technologies but is still inferior to simply mounted CIGS panels. Note that the just panels of the ASF, without the BOS, still has a higher emission factor than the CIGS installation. This is due to lower power production as a result of self shading \cite{hofer2015photovoltaics}, and situations where the panels are not optimally positioned\textcolor{magenta}{\textit{Where do these GHG figures come from?}}.

Are you comparing electricity with materials? Shouldn't it be the net (negative) number, combining material and production?}}}

% - Sourcing location greatly influences the embodied GWP. For photovoltaic panels, the majority of embodied emissions result from the use of electricity during production. The GWP per kwh of the Chinese electricity mix is 1145.8 ${\mathrm{gCO_2eq/kWh}}$, while in Switzerland this is only 119.6 ${\mathrm{gCO_2eq/kWh}}$.
