In this section we detail the inventory, energy plus simulation methodology, important assumptions, and the LCA evaluation method. The assessment considers the environmental impacts of the production, operation, and disposal of an ASF. We assume a life time of 15 years \textcolor{cyan}{based on...}.
\\

\subsection{Life Cycle Inventory and Assumptions}

The mechanical components of the ASF can be broken into four parts: a PV panel, actuator, cantilever, and a cable net supporting structure. The PV panel, actuator and cantilever combine to form a dynamic PV module, which is then mounted on a cable net supporting structure. An exploded view of these components can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:explodedView}. There are also additional electronics which exists off the facade in a separate control box. Theses five components along with the assembly, are the main product systems in the manufacture of the ASF as seen in Figure \ref{fig:BOS}.

\item[PV Panel] \hfill\\
Weight is the primary restriction when selecting a PV panel. Any technology that requires glass encapsulation or a heavy substructure can therefore not be used. This limits us to CIGS and amorphous silicon panels.\\

CIGS PV panels was selected as the thin film panel of choice due to its high efficiency, low cost, and ability to be deposited on a polymer or aluminium substrate \cite{chirilua2011highly}. 

%A less efficient thin film amorphous silicon panel could also be used and will also be discussed in this analysis.\\

\textcolor{magenta}{\textit{(Not sure if it makes sense to provide the entire inventory here. If so, we would probably also need to give expected lifetimes, etc.)}}

\item[Actuator] \hfill \\
Traditionally photovoltaic actuation is done through the use of servo motors. Servo motors however become a limiting factor for adaptive facades due to their high upfront costs, and instability in heavy winds. Soft robotic actuators on the other hand are cheaper and more resilient to harsh environmental conditions\cite{Svetozarevic2014a}. The soft robotic actuators however are still in development and have a life time of five years. They will therefore require two rounds of maintenance during the lifetime of the ASF.
For the purpose of this analysis we will analyse both servo motors and soft robotic actuators.

The supporting structure is the connection point between the array of photovoltaic modules and the building itself. Many different designs are possible, however we will base our analysis of an adaptive solar facade that has already been constructed \cite{nagy2015frontiers}. This design consists of a steel cable-net that spans a steel supporting frame. The steel frame is then attached to the building itself.\\

\subsection{Operational Emissions and Assumptions}
\label{ch:Meth:Opp}

The potential savings are based off previously completed numerical simulations \cite{jayathissa2015abs}. The simulation was conducted on a south facing office room. The room 7m meters in length, 4.9 meters wide and 3.1 meters high was modeled using Rhinoceros 3D CAD Package \cite{Rhino}. Grasshopper \cite{grasshopper} was used to model the dynamic aspects of the ASF which consists of an array of 400mm CIGS solar panels. The geometrical input is imported to Energy Plus \cite{energyplus} though the DIVA \cite{DIVA} interface. A single zone thermal analysis was conducted for each possible geometrical configuration of the ASF for each hour of the year. The results were then post processed in Python \cite{python} with the NumPy \cite{numpy}, and pandas \cite{pandas} plug-ins.\\

We conducted the simulation for three scenarios: 1) facade with no shading, 2) a facade with a static shading system angled at 45$^{\circ}$ to the horizontal axis, and 3) an adaptive solar facade. This analysis purely looks at the building energy performance through adaptive shading and doesn't include PV generation. \\

The building energy savings (kWh) are then converted to a GWP value based on the emission factor of the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) electricity mix (gCO2/kWh) \textcolor{blue}{[Add value and reference]}. \\

The energy required for actuation is also taken into account. It takes \textcolor{red}{0.15Wh} to fully open a single actuator. Based on the assumption of four full openings and closings per day, we approximate the energy requirement to be 174kWh in its lifetime. However as seen in Section \ref{ch:results}, this has a very small impact.\\

\subsection{Evaluation Method}
The life cycle analysis is performed according to the ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 and is performed in five stages 1) goal, 2) scope definition, 3) inventory analysis, 4) impact assessment and 5) interpretation.\\ % 15804 to be discussed

\begin{description}
\item[Goal:] This paper assesses carbon emission reductions, therefore the impact category used is the global warming potential (GWP\textcolor{magenta}{\textit{[IPCC 2013 reference - let me know if you need it]}}). This is described as the emissions of ${\mathrm{gCO_2-eq}}$ divided by the electricity produced in kWh. This is also known as the emission factor (gCO$_2$/kWh) which is expressed in Equation \ref{eq:EF} where ($G$) is the electricity production in (kWh). This analysis will also touch on the regional distributions of GWP and terrestrial acidification to give a complete picture.

\begin{equation}
EF=\frac{{\sum GWP}}{\mathrm{G}}
\label{eq:EF}
\end{equation}

\item[Scope:] The GWP scope consist of Embodied Energy ($GWP_{Em}$), Dynamic Actuation ($GWP_{Act}$), Maintenance ($GWP_{M}$), and Disposal ($GWP_{Disp}$). The GWP savings through adaptive shading ($GWP_{Opp}$) are subtracted to produce our final GWP. This scope is summarised in Figure \ref{fig:BOS}.

\begin{equation}
\sum GWP={\mathrm{GWP_{Em}  + GWP_{Act} + GWP_{M} + GWP_{Disp} - GWP_{Opp} }}
\label{eq:GWP}
\end{equation}

% The functional unit needs to be based on the primary function of the technology. For adaptive building integrated photovoltaics this function can be twofold. When the adaptive BIPV acts as a shading system in front of a glass facade area the functional unit of ${\mathrm{m^2}}$ is used, while a comparison with static facade mounted photovoltaic systems requires the functional unit of electricity produced in ${\mathrm{kWh}}$. \textcolor{magenta}{\textit{(We should discuss the functional unit again. It should be defined more precisely / comprehensively.)}}



% In our assessment, we want to obtain the emission factor (gCO$_2$/kWh) of an ASF as expressed in Equation \ref{eq:EF}. 




The electricity produced, G, in kWh is expressed in Equation \ref{eq:solar} based off International Energy Agency standards [REF REQUIRED]. \textit{I} is the Irradiation \textcolor{red}{(unit)}, ${\eta}$ is the conversion efficiency, \textit{PR} is the performance ratio, \textit{LT} is the service life \textcolor{red}{(unit)}, and \textit{A} is the module area \textcolor{red}{(unit)}.

\begin{equation}
G=\frac{{\mathrm{GWP}}}{{\mathrm{I \cdot \eta  \cdot PR \cdot LT \cdot A}}}
% what is G
\label{eq:solar}
\end{equation}


% The scope of the LCA comprises of the embodied, operational, and disposal global warming impact of the respective system. Figure \ref{fig:BOS} illustrates the system boundaries of the process flows. The supporting structures are also included in the system boundaries. The reason for this is that technologies within the building envelope also change the design of the supporting structures. The supporting structure of solar panels is referred to as balance of systems (BOS).\\

\item[Inventory:] The inventory data was obtained through technical drawings, research papers describing the technology and expert judgement. The Ecoinvent v3.1 database is used as the main LCI database \cite{frischknecht2005ecoinvent}. To keep assumptions consistent, only data from this database is used. \textcolor{magenta}{\textit{(Is that so? Didn't we add a CIGS dataset?)}} Furthermore, the cut-off approach is used for the allocation of recycling and landfill disposal. This means that recycling does not generate any credit for the product and resulting benefits are not taken into account. Furthermore the use of recycled products do not bear the burden of processes higher up the chain.\textcolor{magenta}{\textit{(We don't do any system expansion?)}}\\



\item[Assessment:] For the impact assessment the ReciPe midpoint (H) indicator is used \cite{zelm2009recipe}. \textcolor{magenta}{\textit{(This is a little inconsistent. We should consistently use the term environmental impact as opposed to carbon content, etc.)}} \textcolor{blue}{@Niko, I don't understand what is inconsistent here? Could you suggest some text for this paragraphs?}The impact assessment is performed using the OpenLCA impact assessment tool \cite{ciroth2007ict}. The results of the assessment will be compared with the emission factor of other PV systems \cite{raugei2007life}\\
	% we may need to discuss system expansion
	% PV electricity production not included?

% what LCI DB (ecoinvent) is used? refer to Annex?
% see above. Explain what is included and excluded

\end{description}

\subsection{Sensitivity Analysis}

In order to evaluate the impact of varying parameters on the LCA, we performed a sensitivity analysis on the following assumptions
\begin{itemize}
\item The GWP of the electricity mix
\item The type of actuation system (servo motors compared to soft robotic actuators)
\item The complexity of the control system
\item The uncertainty in the eco-invent background system (Monte Carlo Analysis)
\end{itemize}

% The inputs are summarised in Table \ref{tab:sens}
