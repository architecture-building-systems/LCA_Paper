The analysis looks at the embodied carbon in production, operation, and disposal of the Adaptive Solar Facade (ASF).

\subsection{Embodied Energy Inventory and Assumptions}

The ASF is composed of six sub-product systems described in Figure \ref{fig:subsystem}. This consists of CIGS PV panels mounted on an actuator, supported by a cantilever that offsets it from a cable net supporting structure. An exploded view of these components can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:explodedView}.

\subsubsection*{PV Panel}
The PV panels that can be used are restricted by their weight. Therefore, any technology that requires glass encapsulation or a heavy substructure cannot be used. This limits us to CIGS and amorphous silicon panels [Check this fact again]\\

CIGS PV panels was selected as the thin film panel of choice due to its high efficiency, low cost, and ability to be deposited on a polymer or aluminium substrate \cite{chirilua2011highly}. A less efficient thin film amorphous silicon panel could also be used and will also be discussed in this analysis.\\

\end{table}


\subsubsection*{Actuator}
Traditionally photovoltaic actuation is done through the use of servo motors. Servo motors however become a limiting factor for adaptive facades due to their high upfront costs, and instability in heavy winds. Soft robotic actuators on the other hand are cheaper and more resilient to harsh environmental conditions\cite{Svetozarevic2014a}. For the purpose of this analysis we will analyse both servo motors and soft robotic actuators. \\

\end{table}

\subsubsection*{Cantilever}
The cantilever is a steel connection point between the PV panel and the supporting structure.\\

\label{tab:CantileverInv}
\end{table}

\subsubsection*{Supporting Structure}
The supporting structure is the connection point between the array of photovoltaic modules and the building itself. Many different designs are possible, however we will base our analysis of an adaptive solar facade that has already been constructed \cite{nagy2015frontiers}. This design consists of a steel cable-net that spans a steel supporting frame. The steel frame is then attached to the building itself.\\

\subsubsection*{Controls and Electronic System}

\end{tabular}
\caption{Inventory of main input flows to the manufacturing process of the Control System[ref required]}
\label{tab:ControlInv}
\end{table}

\subsubsection*{Installation}

The installation of the ASF to the building requires a hydraulic hoist which needs to be in operation for eight hours based off previous construction experience \cite{jayathissa2015abs}. \\

\subsection{Operational Emissions and Assumptions}

The potential savings are based off previously completed numerical simulations \cite{jayathissa2015abs}. The simulation was conducted on a south facing office room. The room xx meters in length, xx meters wide and xx meters high was modeled using Rhinoceros 3D CAD Package \cite{Rhino}, shown in Figure XX. Grasshopper \cite{grasshopper} was used to model the dynamic aspects of the ASF which consists of an array of 400mm CIGS solar panels. The geometrical input is imported to Energy Plus \cite{energyplus} though the DIVA \cite{DIVA} interface. A single zone thermal analysis was conducted for each possible geometrical configuration of the ASF for each hour of the year. The results were then post processed in Python \cite{python} with the NumPy \cite{numpy}, and pandas \cite{pandas} plug-ins. \\

Based on the assumption of XX full openings and closings per day, we approximate the energy requirement to actuate the ASF to be YY kWh in its lifetime.\\

\subsection{Evaluation Method}
The life cycle analysis is performed according to the ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 guidelines. The analysis is therefore divided into goal and scope definition, inventory analysis, impact assessment and interpretation\\ % 15804 to be discussed

The goal of this paper is assessing the carbon emission reduction potential, therefore the impact category used is the global warming potential (GWP). This is described as the emissions of ${\mathrm{CO_2-eq}}$ in kilograms divided by the functional unit. The functional unit needs to be based on the primary function of the technology. For adaptive building integrated photovoltaics this function can be twofold. When the adaptive BIPV acts as a shading system in front of a glass facade area the functional unit of ${\mathrm{m^2}}$ is used, while a comparison with static facade mounted photovoltaic systems requires the functional unit of electricity produced in ${\mathrm{kWh}}$. According to the guidelines of the International Energy Agency (IEA), the calculation of kWh produced needs to be based for consistency on the conversion efficiency ${\eta}$, performance ratio PR, irradiation I, lifetime (service life) LT and area A of the module. Equation \ref{eq:solar} gives the exact formulation:
	
\begin{equation}
G=\frac{{\mathrm{GWP}}}{{\mathrm{I \cdot \eta  \cdot PR \cdot LT \cdot A}}}
% what is G
\label{eq:solar}
\end{equation}

The scope of the LCA comprises the embodied, operational and disposal global warming impact of the respective system. Figure \ref{fig:BOS} illustrates the system boundaries of the process flows. The supporting structures are also included in the system boundaries. The reason for this is that technologies within the building envelope also change the design of the supporting structures. The supporting structure of solar panels is referred to as balance of systems (BOS).

\end{figure}

The inventory data was obtained through technical drawings, research papers describing the technology and personal conversations. The Ecoinvent v3.1 database is used as the main LCI database. To keep assumptions consistent, only data from this database is used. Furthermore, the cut-off approach is used for recycling and landfill. This means that recycling does not generate any credit for the product and resulting benefits are not taken into account. Furthermore the use of recycled products do not bear the burden of processes higher up the chain.\\

For the impact assessment the ReciPe midpoint (H) allocation method is used. The impact assessment is performed using the OpenLCA impact assessment tool.
