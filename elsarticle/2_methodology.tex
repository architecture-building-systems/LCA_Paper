In this section, we detail the inventory, Energy Plus simulation methodology, important assumptions, and the LCA evaluation method. The assessment considers the environmental impacts of the production, operation, and disposal of an ASF. We assume a lifetime of 20 years based on the product warranty of the PV panels. The impact assessment is performed according to the ISO 14040 and ISO 14044, \textcolor{cyan}{and is performed in four stages: (1) Goal and Scope Definition, (2) Inventory Analysis, (3) Impact Assessment, and (4) Interpretation} \cite{finkbeiner2006new}.\\\textcolor{magenta}{\sout{using the IPCC 2007 methadology for global warming potential (GWP) assessment}}


\subsection{\textcolor{magenta}{\sout{ Impact Assessment}}}
\textcolor{magenta}{\sout{The life cycle assessment is performed in three stages 1) goal, 2) scope definition, and 3) assessment.}}

\begin{description}
\item[\textcolor{magenta}{\sout{ 1. Goal:}}] \textcolor{magenta}{\sout{ This paper assesses carbon emission reductions. The global warming potential (GWP) impact category is therefore used. This analysis will also touch on the regional distributions of GWP and terrestrial acidification to give a complete picture.The functional unit is the electrical power production of the system in kWh. }}


\item[\textcolor{magenta}{\sout{ 2. Scope:}}] \textcolor{magenta}{\sout{ The scope of the assessment is summarised in Figure \ref{fig:BOS}. We analyse the  manufacture, dynamic actuation, maintenance, disposal and the energy savings through adaptive shading. The scope comprises of a cradle-to-grave approach, where transport to and from site is taken into account. For the database, the cut-off approach is used. This implies that benefits from recycling are out of the scope of this paper. As the analysis is done in Switzerland we assume irradiation on the Facade of 966kWh/m$^2$/year.}}


% The GWP is computed as
% \begin{equation}
% \sum GWP={\mathrm{GWP_{Em}  + GWP_{Act} + GWP_{M} + GWP_{Disp} - GWP_{Opp} }},
% \label{eq:GWP}
% \end{equation}
% where $GWP_{Em}$ is the Embodied Energy, $GWP_{Act}$ is the Dynamic Actuation, $GWP_{M}$ is Maintenance, and $GWP_{Disp}$ is Disposal. The GWP savings through adaptive shading $GWP_{Opp}$ are subtracted to produce our final GWP. This scope is summarised in Figure \ref{fig:BOS}. 

%\textcolor{red}{\textit{What does the sum sign refer to? This does not make sense to me. It should be GWP = ... // Also, why are those terms in uppercase?}}

% The functional unit needs to be based on the primary function of the technology. For adaptive building integrated photovoltaics this function can be twofold. When the adaptive BIPV acts as a shading system in front of a glass facade area the functional unit of ${\mathrm{m^2}}$ is used, while a comparison with static facade mounted photovoltaic systems requires the functional unit of electricity produced in ${\mathrm{kWh}}$. \textcolor{magenta}{\textit{(We should discuss the functional unit again. It should be defined more precisely / comprehensively.)}}

% In our assessment, we want to obtain the emission factor (gCO$_2$/kWh) of an ASF as expressed in Equation \ref{eq:EF}. 

% The electricity production, G, in kWh is expressed as
% \begin{equation}
% G=\frac{{\mathrm{GWP}}}{{\mathrm{I \cdot \eta  \cdot PR \cdot LT \cdot A}}}
% % what is G
% \label{eq:solar}
% \end{equation}
% based on [REF REQUIRED]. In~(\ref{eq:solar}) \textit{I} is the Irradiation \textcolor{red}{(unit)}, ${\eta}$ is the conversion efficiency, \textit{PR} is the performance ratio, \textit{LT} is the service life \textcolor{red}{(unit)}, and \textit{A} is the module area \textcolor{red}{(unit)}.
% \textcolor{red}{\textit{I rewrote this a little bit. You should try to a) make the equations part of the text, and b) the way you use the variables in the text should be the same as in the equations. Now you have I in italics in the text but as textrm in the actual equation. If you add the amsmath package you can use $\backslash$eqref to reference equations directly.\\
% Also why is G even used in this paragraph?}}


% The scope of the LCA comprises of the embodied, operational, and disposal global warming impact of the respective system. Figure \ref{fig:BOS} illustrates the system boundaries of the process flows. The supporting structures are also included in the system boundaries. The reason for this is that technologies within the building envelope also change the design of the supporting structures. The supporting structure of solar panels is referred to as balance of systems (BOS).\\

%\item[3. Inventory] The inventory data was obtained from technical drawings, research papers describing the technology, and expert judgement. The Ecoinvent v3.1 database is used as the main LCI database \cite{frischknecht2005ecoinvent}. To keep assumptions consistent, only data from this database is used. \textcolor{magenta}{\textit{(Is that so? Didn't we add a CIGS dataset?)}} Furthermore, the cut-off approach is used for the allocation of recycling and landfill disposal. This means that recycling does not generate any credit for the product and resulting benefits are not taken into account. Furthermore the use of recycled products do not bear the burden of processes higher up the chain.\textcolor{magenta}{\textit{(We do system expansion once we give credits for electricity production.)}}\\

\item[\textcolor{magenta}{\sout{ 3. GWP Assessment:}}] \textcolor{magenta}{\sout{ The assessment is based on the IPCC 2007 methodology \cite{solomon2007climate}. The GWP assessment is performed using the OpenLCA assessment tool \cite{ciroth2007ict}. In the assessment, we compare the emission factor (EF) of an ASF with other PV systems.

\item[1. Goal and Scope Definition]: \textcolor{cyan}{This paper primarily assesses carbon emission reductions therefore the global warming potential (GWP) impact category is primarily assessed. The assessment also looks at six other major ReCiPe midpoint indicators: terrestrial acidification potential (TAP), freshwater eutrophication potential (FEP), human toxicity potential (HTP), metal depletion potential (MDP), and photochemical oxidant formation potential (POFP). These categories are most relevant to the technology and most widely used in existing literature \cite{ortiz2009sustainability}. The functional unit is the electrical power production of the system in kWh.}

\textcolor{cyan}{\textcolor{magenta}{\sout{The scope of the assessment is summarised in Figure \ref{fig:BOS}.

We analyse the manufacture, dynamic actuation, maintenance, and disposal of the solar facade. The scope comprises of a cradle-to-grave approach, where transport to and from site is taken into account. 
In order to account for the multi-functionality aspect of the ASF (i.e. electricity production and shading benefit), we carry out a sensitivity analysis and expand the system boundary including operational energy savings through adaptive shading. \textcolor{magenta}{\sout{ For the database, the cut-off approach is used. This implies that benefits from recycling are out of the scope of this paper.}} As the life cycle inventory (LCI) background database we use Ecoinvent v3.1 \cite{frischknecht2005ecoinvent} with the cut-off system model \footnote{\textcolor{cyan}{http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/system-models-in-ecoinvent-3/cut-off-system-model/allocation-cut-off-by-classification.html   -  \textit{Accessed: 8.2.2016}}}. That means impacts are allocated to the primary use of the product and it receives no credit for the provision of recycled material. Once a product is disposed or recycled, it leaves the system boundary and the recycled product comes “burden-free”.}

\subsection{Embodied Life Cycle Inventory}
\label{ch:meth:Embodied}

%The inventory data was obtained from technical drawings, research papers describing the technology, and expert judgment. 


The mechanical components of an ASF can be broken into four parts: a PV panel, actuator, cantilever, and a cable net supporting structure. The PV panel, actuator and cantilever combine to form a dynamic PV module, which is then mounted on a cable net supporting structure. An exploded view of these components can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:explodedView}. There are also additional electronics which exists off the facade in a separate control box. Theses five components along with the assembly, are the main product systems in the manufacture of an ASF as seen in Figure \ref{fig:BOS}. The inventory quantities are given in specific mass quantity (SMQ), which is the mass in kg of the specific materials.

%\textcolor{magenta}{\textit{\\It is absolutely necessary that we describe the system boundary (what is included and what not (e.g. transport) and why) and also the functional unit! Were all life phases properly described? What happens in the maintenance, disposal phase? Will we have an annex? If so, we should give the ecoinvent inventories there.}}

\item[PV Panel] \hfill\\
Weight is the primary restriction when selecting a PV panel. Any technology that requires glass encapsulation or a heavy substructure can therefore not be used. The technology also needs to be on the market with high module efficiency. CIGS PV panels were selected as the thin film panel of choice due to its high efficiency, low cost, and ability to be deposited on a polymer or aluminium substrate \cite{chirilua2011highly}.

\item[Actuator] \hfill \\
Traditionally photovoltaic actuation is done through the use of servo motors. Servo motors however become a limiting factor for adaptive facades due to their high upfront costs, and instability in heavy winds. Soft robotic actuators on the other hand are cheaper and more resilient to harsh environmental conditions\cite{Svetozarevic2014a}. The soft robotic actuators however are still in development and have an estimated lifetime of five years. They will therefore require three rounds of maintenance during the lifetime of the ASF.
For the purpose of this analysis we will analyse both servo motors and soft robotic actuators.

\subsection{Operational Life Cycle Inventory}
\label{ch:Meth:Opp}

The operational inventory is categorised as 1) energy consumption of an office room 2) electricity consumption through dynamic actuation, and 3) maintenance.

\begin{description}


\item[Building Energy Consumption: ] \hfill\\
\textcolor{cyan}{As described previously we also perform  a sensitivity analysis that accounts for the energy savings due to the shading effect.} An adaptive shading system, when mounted over a glazed facade, has an impact on the energy consumption of the building. More specifically, it has an impact on the heating cooling and lighting loads as described in Section \ref{ch:introduction}. Previously conducted simulations compared three scenarios: 1) facade with no shading, 2) a facade with a static shading system, optimally angled at 45$^{\circ}$ to the horizontal axis, and 3) an adaptive solar facade \cite{jayathissa2015abs}.\\

The simulation was conducted on a south facing office room. The room, 7.0 meters in length, 4.9 meters wide and 3.1 meters high was modeled using Rhinoceros 3D CAD Package \cite{Rhino}. Grasshopper \cite{grasshopper} was used to model the orientation of each photovoltaic panel. The geometrical input is imported to Energy Plus \cite{energyplus} through the DIVA \cite{DIVA} interface. A single zone thermal analysis was conducted for each possible geometrical configuration of the ASF for each hour of the year. The results were then post processed in MATLAB \cite{MATLAB}.\\

The simulations show a total energy saving of 25\% compared to static panels at 45$^\circ$ and 56\% compared to a case with no facade shading \cite{jayathissa2015abs}. These results are sumarised in Figure \ref{fig:operational}. \\

\end{mdframed}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

% ASF, when mounted over a glazed surface has an impact on the energy consumption of the office space behind the facade. In particular 
% An adaptive shading system reduce the electrical consumption of a building through reductions in heating, cooling and lighting \cite{jayathissa2015abs}. \textcolor{magenta}{\textit{I'd be more verbose. How does it affect energy demand? A "saving" is always relative - so it should probably refer to a base case.}}
% These electrical savings can be translated into GWP savings based on the emission factor of the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) electricity mix (462.1gCO2/kWh)\cite{itten2012life}.\\

\item[Dynamic Actuation: ] The energy required for actuation is also taken into account. It takes 0.31Wh to fully open a single actuator. Based on the assumption of four full openings and closings per day per actuator, we approximate the combined energy requirement to be 489kWh in its 20 year lifetime. 
%However as seen in Section \ref{ch:results}, this has a \textcolor{magenta}{\sout{very} relatively} small impact.\\

\item[Maintenance: ] Soft robotic actuators currently have a lifetime of five years, and therefore will need to be replaced three times during the 20 year lifetime of an ASF. No other maintenance efforts are considered for the assessment of 20 years.

\subsection{Sensitivity Analysis}
\label{ch:meth:sens}

In order to evaluate the impact of varying parameters on the LCA, we performed a sensitivity analysis on the following assumptions
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{cyan}{When an ASF is built over a glazed building surface, thus including the effects of adaptive shading on the building energy consumption}
\item \textcolor{magenta}{\sout{The GWP of the electricity mix}} \textcolor{cyan}{The location of the ASF including the effects of the GWP of the local electricity mix. Assessments will also be run in Madrid and Geneva}
\item A static version of the ASF, where panels are optimally orientated to 45$^{\circ}$
\item The type of actuation system (servo motors compared to soft robotic actuators)
\item The complexity of the control system. \textcolor{cyan}{The ASF can be built where each panel is independently actuated, or a case where it is actuated in rows. When the panels are actuated independently more valves and control electronics are required.}
%\item The uncertainty in the eco-invent background system (Monte Carlo Analysis)
