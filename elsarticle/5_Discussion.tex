- When is the ASF advantages, when is it not

- Would it be better to just have a optimally angled static system?

- Limitations of the study

- Nuclear power in France and Switzerland

- No need to purchase land, advantage of facade integration

- What should designers of adaptive solar facades keep in mind 

- Other advantages of the ASF that are not clear in the LCA analysis, such as daylighting and user centered control 

- Have a technology where you can put PV where you normally can't put PV


-It is interesting to note that the choice of actuation system for an ASF can have a significant / minimal impact on the embodied emissions. [Elaborate further when results come in]
