Buildings are at the heart of society and currently account for 32\% of global final energy consumption and 19\% of energy related greenhouse gas emissions \cite{IPCC}

- In the last decades, building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) have been adopted as part of the energy strategy towards 2050... \

(advantages of BIPV, potential of BIPV)\\
% Do we have a source for "have been adopted as part of the energy strategy towards 2050"?
%Yes - PJ

- The current developments of light-weight efficient thin film technologies have brought new design possibilities for architects in BIPV design... \

(Adaptive Building Envelopes, examples, Envelope is the barrier between the internal and external environment, Advantages, seamless coupling with solar tracking mechanics) \\

- One example of a multi functional facade that was recently released is the Adaptive Solar Facade.\\

- The aim of this paper is to analyse the life cycle emissions of an adaptive solar facade and provide comparisons with standard shading systems and static BIPV solutions.\\
