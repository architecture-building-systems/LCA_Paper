Buildings are at the heart of society and currently account for 32\% of global final energy consumption and 19\% of energy related greenhouse gas emissions \cite{IPCC}. Nevertheless the building sector has a 50-90\% emission reduction potential using existing technologies, and widespread implementation could see energy use in buildings stabilise or even fall by 2050. Within this strategy, building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) has the potential of providing a substantial segment of a building's energy needs \cite{Shoen1997}. Even the photovoltaic (PV) industry has identified BIPV as one of the four key factors for the future success of PV \cite{raugei2009life}. \\

Recent developments regarding efficiency and costs of thin film BIPV technologies, in particular, CIGS, have brought new design possibilities \cite{NREL} \cite{kushiya2014cis} \cite{kaelin2004low} \cite{jelle2012building}. Their light weight nature and customisable shapes allow for easier and more aesthetically pleasing integration into the building envelope. In addition, less power is required to actuate them, thus facilitating the development of dynamic envelope elements \cite{rossi2012adaptive}. \\


% \textcolor{cyan}{The PV industry is currently dominated by crystaline silicon photovoltaic cells due to their high efficiency and low processing costs \cite{saga2010advances}. However these technologies are often difficult to integrate in a way that maintains the architectural expression of the building \cite{Lueling2009ee}. This combined with their intrinsic weight restricts their large scale implementation to roofs where they are out of sight. However,} in the last decade, there has been interesting developments in second generation thin film technologies \cite{NREL}. In particular, Cu(In,Ga)Se$_2$ (CIGS) is reaching  competitive levels of efficiencies \cite{kushiya2014cis} and manufacturing costs \cite{kaelin2004low} \cite{jelle2012building}.\\



Dynamic buildings envelopes have gained interest in recent years because they can save energy by controlling the flow of direct and indirect radiation into the building, while still responding to the desires of the user \cite{loonen2013climate}. This mediation of solar isolation offers a reduction in heating / cooling loads and an improvement of daylight distribution \cite{rossi2012adaptive}. Interestingly the mechanics that actuate dynamic envelopes couples seamlessly with the mechanics required for facade integrated PV solar tracking. The use of light weight PV as an adaptive envelope material enables it to also benefit from on-site energy production. Furthermore, it provides a new way of aesthetically integrating PV panels onto buildings. The balance of electricity production, and adaptive shading can in some cases offset the entire energy demand of an office space behind the envelope \cite{jayathissa2015abs}. We have proposed one possible combination of these technologies as the Adaptive Solar Facade (ASF) \cite{nagy2015frontiers}.

The design of an ASF comes at an added cost. The additional electronics, actuators, and supporting structure adds further embodied CO$_2$ to the product. It is therefore important to conduct a life cycle impact assessment (LCA) to analyse whether the carbon savings during operation offsets the increased embodied carbon emissions in manufacture. It is also important to see how variations in design can alter the GHG reduction potential of the technology. Aspects such as the chosen actuator, control system, and location of operation can have a significant impact on its environmental performance. There has already been work conducted on static photovoltaic systems \cite{raugei2007life}, however this has not yet been expanded to dynamic BIPV systems. \\

In this paper, we investigate the environmental performance of an ASF and compare it to existing static photovoltaic systems based off previous research \cite{raugei2007life}. We also investigate 1) Design variations of the ASF, 2) the operational emissions of a building, with and without an ASF, 3) its global and local environmental impact, and 4) the sensitivity of the LCA to its location and design


%In this paper we investigate the trade-off between added material and on-site energy production, along with other benefits such as adaptive shading. We assess 1) the ASF system with possible design variations, 2) the operation of a building with an ASF, 3) its global and local environmental impact, 4) the sensitivity of the LCA to the design and location, and 5) provide a comparison with existing static PV technologies. \\

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section introduces the ASF and the used LCA methodology. In Section \ref{ch:results}, we present the results of the LCA analysis. Section \ref{ch:discussion} discusses the results and provides design guidelines. Section \ref{ch:conclusion} concludes the paper.
