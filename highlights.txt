Highlights

•	Embodied environmental impact of the investigated dynamic BIPV system is 25% {Check This} higher than a static system
•	Environmental impacts are sensitive to the selection of actuators, control system, and structure
•	Savings in energy demand due to adaptive shading can offset the embodied environmental impact
•	Dynamic BIPV systems can be a preferable solution, when shading effects are taken into account
