Highlights

•	The embodied environmental impact of a dynamic BIPV system is higher than a static system
•	Selection of actuators, control system and structure can reduce its environmental impact
•	Savings through adaptive shading offsets the entire embodied environmental impact
•	Dynamic BIPV systems are a preferred solution for glazed building surfaces
