Highlights

•	Environmental impact of the dynamic BIPV system is 50% higher than a static system
•	Environmental impacts are sensitive to the selection of actuators, and structure
•	Savings due to adaptive shading can offset the embodied environmental impact
•	Dynamic BIPV systems can be a preferable, when shading effects are included
