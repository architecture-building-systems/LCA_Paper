	\opening{Dear Dr Espinosa and Prof. Krebs,}
	We hereby submit our manuscript entitled \emph{Life Cycle Assessment of Dynamic Building Integrated Photovoltaics}. 
	Our manuscript assesses the field of dynamic building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems, which is gaining interest due to the increasing efficiencies of light weight, thin film PV technologies. 


	%The increasing efficiency of light weight, thin film photovoltaic technologies, has enabled a growth in interest of dynamic BIPV systems. This is because dynamic BIPV systems can combine the benefits of adaptive building shading, with solar tracking. 

	%This study investigates the environmental performance of dynamic BIPV systems. In particular to assess whether the additional material and actuation costs are offset by the the savings to the buildings energy demand. 

	We find that the environmental performance of a dynamic BIPV system is only beneficial when adaptive shading effects are taken into account. A system with solar tracking alone is inferior to simple static BIPV solutions. We also present design considerations for the design of dynamic BIPV systems.
	Because our findings can be applied in practice right away, they are likely to be of great interest to the vision of researchers, engineers, and architects who read your journal. 

	This manuscript describes original work and is not under consideration by any other journal. All authors approved the manuscript and this submission.


	Thank you for receiving our manuscript and considering it for review. We appreciate your time and look forward to your response.
